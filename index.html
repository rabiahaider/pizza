Pizza is a regular visitor to our house â€” &nbsp; only it doesn't usually come from a delivery person. Making homemade pizza from prepared dough is a quick and easy dinner any night of the week. Even making your own dough only really adds a few minutes to the prep time! Pile on your favorite toppings and get ready to chow down.
</br>

<h4> 3 Steps for Awesome Pizza at Home </h4>
<h4> 1. Make your own pizza dough.</h4>


Yes, you can buy pretty decent pizza dough from the bakery counter at your grocery store, but why bother when you can easily mix up a batch at home for pennies? Use any one of our pizza dough recipes to get started.

While the rise time on most of these is relative short (one to two hours), you can mix the dough the night or morning before and let the dough rise slowly all day. Be sure to bring the dough to room temperature for an hour before shaping.

My favorite method for shaping the pizza is to roll the dough onto a piece of parchment paper. The dough sticks to the parchment, making it easier to work with and easier to transfer into the oven. The pizza will release from the parchment during cooking and the parchment can be removed halfway through cooking. The parchment darkens in the oven, but doesn't burn or catch fire.<br><br>

When it comes to red sauce, trust us when we say a simple, no-cook blender sauce is best. Pesto or rich ricotta are wonderful substitutes as well.
